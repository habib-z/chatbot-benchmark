# metric: factual_correctness

## prompt key: claim_decomposition_prompt

    Decompose and break down each of the input sentences into one or more standalone statements. Each statement should be a standalone claim that can be independently verified.
    Follow the level of atomicity and coverage as shown in the examples.
    
Decompose both response and reference into atomic claims before NLI.
Please return the output in a JSON format that complies with the following schema as specified in JSON Schema:
{"properties": {"claims": {"items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Decomposed Claims", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["claims"], "title": "ClaimDecompositionOutput", "type": "object"}Do not use single quotes in your response but double quotes,properly escaped with a backslash.

--------EXAMPLES-----------
Example 1
Input: {
    "response": "Charles Babbage was a French mathematician, philosopher, and food critic."
}
Output: {
    "claims": [
        "Charles Babbage was a mathematician.",
        "Charles Babbage was a philosopher.",
        "Charles Babbage was a food critic.",
        "Charles Babbage was French."
    ]
}

Example 2
Input: {
    "response": "Albert Einstein was a German theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity and also contributed to the development of quantum mechanics."
}
Output: {
    "claims": [
        "Albert Einstein was a German theoretical physicist.",
        "Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity.",
        "Albert Einstein contributed to the development of quantum mechanics."
    ]

## prompt key: n_l_i_statement_prompt
Your task is to judge the faithfulness of a series of statements based on a given context. For each statement you must return verdict as 1 if the statement can be directly inferred based on the context or 0 if the statement can not be directly inferred based on the context.
Decompose both response and reference into atomic claims before NLI.
Please return the output in a JSON format that complies with the following schema as specified in JSON Schema:
{"$defs": {"StatementFaithfulnessAnswer": {"properties": {"statement": {"description": "the original statement, word-by-word", "title": "Statement", "type": "string"}, "reason": {"description": "the reason of the verdict", "title": "Reason", "type": "string"}, "verdict": {"description": "the verdict(0/1) of the faithfulness.", "title": "Verdict", "type": "integer"}}, "required": ["statement", "reason", "verdict"], "title": "StatementFaithfulnessAnswer", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"statements": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/StatementFaithfulnessAnswer"}, "title": "Statements", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["statements"], "title": "NLIStatementOutput", "type": "object"}Do not use single quotes in your response but double quotes,properly escaped with a backslash.

--------EXAMPLES-----------
Example 1
Input: {
    "context": "John is a student at XYZ University. He is pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He is enrolled in several courses this semester, including Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management. John is a diligent student and spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. He often stays late in the library to work on his projects.",
    "statements": [
        "John is majoring in Biology.",
        "John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.",
        "John is a dedicated student.",
        "John has a part-time job."

Output: {
    "statements": [
        {
            "statement": "John is majoring in Biology.",
            "reason": "John's major is explicitly mentioned as Computer Science. There is no information suggesting he is majoring in Biology.",
            "verdict": 0
        },
        {
            "statement": "John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.",
            "reason": "The context mentions the courses John is currently enrolled in, and Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be deduced that John is taking a course on AI.",
            "verdict": 0
        },
        {
            "statement": "John is a dedicated student.",
            "reason": "The context states that he spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. Additionally, it mentions that he often stays late in the library to work on his projects, which implies dedication.",
            "verdict": 1
        },
        {
            "statement": "John has a part-time job.",

            "verdict": 0
        }

Example 2
Input: {
    "context": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy.",
    "statements": [
        "Albert Einstein was a genius."

Output: {
    "statements": [
        {
            "statement": "Albert Einstein was a genius.",
            "reason": "The context and statement are unrelated",
