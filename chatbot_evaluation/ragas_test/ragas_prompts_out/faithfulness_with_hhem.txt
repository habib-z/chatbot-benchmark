# metric: faithfulness_with_hhem

## prompt key: n_l_i_statement_prompt
Your task is to judge the faithfulness of a series of statements based on a given context. For each statement you must return verdict as 1 if the statement can be directly inferred based on the context or 0 if the statement can not be directly inferred based on the context.
Prefer short rationales; focus on explicit support in context.
Please return the output in a JSON format that complies with the following schema as specified in JSON Schema:
{"$defs": {"StatementFaithfulnessAnswer": {"properties": {"statement": {"description": "the original statement, word-by-word", "title": "Statement", "type": "string"}, "reason": {"description": "the reason of the verdict", "title": "Reason", "type": "string"}, "verdict": {"description": "the verdict(0/1) of the faithfulness.", "title": "Verdict", "type": "integer"}}, "required": ["statement", "reason", "verdict"], "title": "StatementFaithfulnessAnswer", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"statements": {"items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/StatementFaithfulnessAnswer"}, "title": "Statements", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["statements"], "title": "NLIStatementOutput", "type": "object"}Do not use single quotes in your response but double quotes,properly escaped with a backslash.

--------EXAMPLES-----------
Example 1
Input: {
    "context": "John is a student at XYZ University. He is pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He is enrolled in several courses this semester, including Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management. John is a diligent student and spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. He often stays late in the library to work on his projects.",
    "statements": [
        "John is majoring in Biology.",
        "John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.",
        "John is a dedicated student.",
        "John has a part-time job."
    ]
}
Output: {
    "statements": [
        {
            "statement": "John is majoring in Biology.",
            "reason": "John's major is explicitly mentioned as Computer Science. There is no information suggesting he is majoring in Biology.",
            "verdict": 0
        },
        {
            "statement": "John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.",
            "reason": "The context mentions the courses John is currently enrolled in, and Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be deduced that John is taking a course on AI.",
            "verdict": 0
        },
        {
            "statement": "John is a dedicated student.",
            "reason": "The context states that he spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. Additionally, it mentions that he often stays late in the library to work on his projects, which implies dedication.",
            "verdict": 1
        },
        {
            "statement": "John has a part-time job.",
            "reason": "There is no information given in the context about John having a part-time job.",
            "verdict": 0
        }
    ]
}

Example 2
Input: {
    "context": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy.",
    "statements": [
        "Albert Einstein was a genius."
    ]
}
Output: {
    "statements": [
        {
            "statement": "Albert Einstein was a genius.",
            "reason": "The context and statement are unrelated",
            "verdict": 0
        }
    ]
}
